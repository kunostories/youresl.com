English Courses is a web app I've wanted to build for years. The main purpose of the app is to give my ESL (English as a Second Language) students a chance to practice/study English at home on the Internet. Students can sign up and log in to their own account, edit their profile, and view content.

Once you sign up and log in, you will be able to edit your profile which includes an alias, first and last name, email, age, and location. The form is client-side validated by Javascript. You don't have to edit your profile. You will also be prompted to enroll in a course. Clicking on the link in the 'alert' or clicking on 'All Courses' in the top navigation will take you to a list of the current courses available. If you click on 'My Courses' in the top navigation, it will redirect you to the 'All Courses' page if you haven't enrolled in any courses. Once there, you can learn more about the course and see the content (but not view the content), or you can enroll in the course (which will allow you to view the content).

Enroll in the Pronunciation Course. Then view the content. You should be able to view the previous and next content (if it exists) and the progress bar should update depending on the last content you viewed. For example: if you click on the 4th content, your progress bar will show 80% (4 out of 5).

Features:

- Sign up
- Log in
- Log out
- Edit profile
- Enroll in course
- View course contents (aka lessons)
- Progress bar updates based on last content viewed

- Accordion on 'My Courses' while looking at 'All Courses' if enrolled in any courses

Note:
* Due to disk quota for ASO, some of the videos in the content are missing. The intro video on the landing page, the 'f' sound pronunciation videos, and the review video are available.
